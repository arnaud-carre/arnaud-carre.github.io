My name is Arnaud Carr√©. I started programming for video game industry back in 1994 (yes you can call me boomer). Everything started because of me beeing fascinated by demos

### My story

I started programming in Basic on a Amstrad CPC 6128. Then I bought an Atari ST and serious things started when we founded the "Oxygene" demo crew with good friends
