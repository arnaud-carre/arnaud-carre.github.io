My name is Arnaud Carr√©. I also use the nickname **Leonard** from **Oxygene** in the demoscene micro society. Serious things started when I learned assembly programming and founded the "Oxygene" demo crew with good friends around 1990 (yes you can call me boomer)  
For a living I'm currently a graphics engineer at Unity, mostly working with modern hardware and GPU. In my spare time I still enjoy programming demo effects or tools for retro computers such as Atari ST and Amiga 500.  

I think these two worlds (retro & modern) have a lot in common. Modern techniques could be applied efficiently in the retro world, and vice versa.

This is what I want to focus on in my blog.
