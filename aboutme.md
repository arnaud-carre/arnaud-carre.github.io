My name is Arnaud Carr√©. I also use the nickname **Leonard** from **Oxygene** in the demoscene micro society.

### My story

I started programming in Basic on a Amstrad CPC 6128. Then I bought an Atari ST and serious things started when we founded the "Oxygene" demo crew with good friends. I started professional programming for video game industry back in 1994 (yes you can call me boomer). Currently working as Graphics Engineer at Unity
